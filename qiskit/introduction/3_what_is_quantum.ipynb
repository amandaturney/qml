The cards were divided into grids and each cell in the grid represented a bit where a hole represented '1', and no hole represented '0'. Changing the value of a bit required punching a new hole or _patching_ the hole back up.\n",

    "* Compact disks: CDs were created in the 80s to store audio records using bits where pits and troughs on the surface to represented the bits' values and lasers were used to sweep over for reading/detecting the bits. The disk is read along a spiral line, divided into segments.\n",

    "* Electron orbitals: Electrons can be found in discretized/quantum distances away from a nucleus (shells). If the shell that an electron is in can be detected, then we can pick two shells and give the atom a state of 0 for being in one shell and a state of 1 for being in the other shell.\n",
