We can see how easily that scaling this to the same size input as the additional algorithm (1000 digit number) would be an unmanageable/impossible task to carry out.\n",

The second issue is the error rate: quantum effects are delicate and thus the QCs are noisy.\n",

Right now, IBM has a 65-qubit machine and will have a 1000 qubits by 2023. The estimate for solving the 617-digit RSA encryption assumed ~20 million qubits so we're still a while off from that, but this time period could be reminescent of the early days of the first transistor being invented in 1947.
