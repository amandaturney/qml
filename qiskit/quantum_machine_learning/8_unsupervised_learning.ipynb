There are a number of different classical and quantum algorithms for different unsupervised learning tasks that include PCA, clustering, variational autoencoders, and generative adversarial networks."

Given a set of data (classical or quantum) from a probability distribution $P_{real}$, GANs train a generator, $G_{\\theta}$, and discriminator, $D_{\\phi}$, simultaneously create samples from $P_G$ that are indistinguishable from $P_real$. This model is coverred in more detail in the next page."
