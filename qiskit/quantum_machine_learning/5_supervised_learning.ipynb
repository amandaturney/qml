    "The general procedure for QVC is to first encode datapoints from a classical dataset into the quantum states using a quantum feature map. Those states are then processed with a parameterized quantum circuit, $W(\\theta)$. The parameters of the quantum model are optimized such that the resultant state matches the target state $\\ket{y_i}$ where $y_i$ is the label of the training points.\n",
