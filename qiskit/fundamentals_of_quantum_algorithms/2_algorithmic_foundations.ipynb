    "Output: the prime factorization of $N$\n",
    "\n",

For instance, the prime factors of 12 are 2 and 3 where 12 = 2 x 2 x 3. For each positive integer of $N \\ge 2$, there is only one prime factorization which is a fact known as the _fundamental theorem of arithmetic_.\n",

Through binary strings, we can encode a variety of interesting objects such as numbers, vectors, matrices, and graphs, as well as lists of these and other objects. Below are some examples:\n",

    "Elementary operations are operations that involve a small, fixed number of bits/qubits that can be performed quickly and easily. For circuit based models of computation, it is typical that each _gate_ is viewed as an elementary operation. Qiskit is going to adopt the following as the default gate set for quantum circuits: $X, Y, Z, H, S, S^{\\dagger}, T, T^{\\dagger}, CNOT$, and standard basis measurements. However, sometimes people view Toffoli, Hadamard, S gates, and standard basis measurements as being elementary.\n",

    "The unitary gates in the default set listed above are called the _universal_ gate set. This means that any unitary operation can be approximated on any number of qubits and to any degree of accuracy with circuits composed of these gates alone. So this just basically means that any state can be created using however many gates from this set as you want given the precision you're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "For Boolean circuits, the elementary operations are: AND, OR, NOT, and FANOUT. These form a universal set for deterministic computations meaning that any function from any fixed number of input bits to a fixed numberof output bits can be implemented with these gates."

    "An important aspect of quantum circuits is the idea of deferred measurement. Ideally, we don't want to be making measurements in the mdidle of our circuit; its just easier to have our quantum computations consist of a completely unitary part followed by a read-out measurement phase at the end. This can always be done provided we're willing to add an additional qubit for each measurement. Look at the circuits below: the left makes an instant measurement and writes to a classical bit (represented by double lined wires on the bottom) whereas the circuit on the right can be seen as \"writing the value of a qubit to another qubit\" and then we can continue using the initial qubit and can measure the other one later.\n",

    "The total number of gates within a circuiit is the circuit's size and thus its _computational cost_, represented by size(C). The number of gates/elementary operations is meant to be a proxy for the time it will take to perform a computation. But this isn't always a perfect proportion because sometimes gates can be performed in parallel leading to bigger circuits being run faster than smaller circuits if there is more parallelization available. Thus, a different way to measure efficiency for circuits is to measure their _depth_, which is the minimum number of layers of gates needed within the circuit. This is also the maximum number of gates encountered on any path from an input wire to an output wire."

In our Boolean circuits, FANOUT gates are typically viewed as being free and having actually 0 cost. In our query models in the last section, we gave a unit cost for each query of the input function but said every other operation (such as the Hadamards before and after the query) was free. Lastly, on some hardware, some gates are more expensive than others. So while it is not necessarily true to say all elementary gates have the same cost, we'll keep to simpler models of computational cost."

This generality allows us to observe what we saw before with the addition Boolean circuit: it scales linearly. This statement is true whether we consider XOR gates as elementary or not, FANOUTS as not, etc; it still is linear and thus this level of complexity analysis is not sensitive to low level details like that.\n",

    "One final cost of circuit computation is the cost associated with the pattern of the circuits themselves. For example, the description of each member $C_n$ in a circuit family could be determined by some extremely difficult to compute function of $n$. This is definitely a problem and thus this course only introduces families of circuits that have _uniformity_ meaning they are computationally easy to obtain the descriptoin of each circuit in a family. So while a circuit could be simply to run, it could be very computationally difficult to describe and that is the cost that we are 1) ignorinig here and 2) assuming is low and neglible."

    "A Tofolli gate can be combined with some NOT gates to also create the equivalent of an OR gate. FANOUT gates are easily implemented by CNOT gates in the same way that the _deferred measurement_ was done. Lastly, NOT gates are implemented through an NOT unitary operator (X gate). Ultimately, we can take a classical Boolean circuit (left) and convert it to a quantum circuit (right) where we have our input state $\\ket{x}$ in the top n qubits and $\\ket{f(x)}$ encoded in the top n qubits after the circuit is run, as well as k workspace qubits on the bottom that we can mostly disregard.\n",

    "If all we want our circuit to do is compute f(x), then the above quantum circuit is fine. However, if we wish to use it as a subroutine, then we need to clean up the \"garbage\" or the stuff encoded in the workspace qubits because otherwise, they will interfere with other components of the overall computational routine/circuit. This is pretty straightforward for a quantum circuit because all we need to do to \"clean up the garbage\" is to reset the workspace by running the circuit in reverse on them. What this becomes then is the addition of _another_ m qubits for which we can \"copy\" the output $\\ket{f(x)}$ to using CNOT, and then we can run the reverse of our circuit to get back the final registers of $\\ket{x}, \\ket{0^k}, \\ket{y \\oplus f(x)}$.\n",

    "If our classical algorithm has t gates, then the circuit above has O(t) gates so its a linear scale of t. In the circuit above, if we ignore the k qubits for the workspace, it looks like a query gate. We can use it such that if we encode an input x into the top register and have the y register be all 0s, when we run the circuit, we'll get f(x) on the bottom m qubits. Or we could encode the y register to be something different to maybe take advantage of phase kickback like in Deutsch's or Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. This shows that any query algorithm that can be computed on a Boolean circuiit can be converted to a unitary implementation."
